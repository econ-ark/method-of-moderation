## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PDF (current), will be converted to PNG/WebP by MyST during build
- **Resolution**: High resolution for publication quality
- **Size**: Figures are displayed at 80% width in the paper
- **Alt text**: Each image has descriptive alt text for accessibility

## MyST Figure Features

These images use MyST's figure directive with:

- Semantic labels for cross-referencing (e.g., `fig:ExtrapProblem`)
- Alt text for accessibility
- Consistent styling (center-aligned, 80% width)
- Proper captions explaining the mathematical content

## Build Process

During the MyST build process, these PDF images are automatically converted to:

- PNG format for web display
- WebP format for optimized web delivery
- Other formats as needed for different export targets

The conversion process requires ImageMagick with PDF support enabled.

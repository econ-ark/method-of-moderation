After describing conditions under which a consumption function exists, the paper articulates stricter 'Growth Impatience' conditions that guarantee alternative forms of 'target' saving - either at the population level, or for individual consumers. Together, the numerical tools and analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock models.},
